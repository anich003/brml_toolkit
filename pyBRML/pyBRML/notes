>>> s = PotentialSystem()
>>> s.add_variable('knife',['used','not_used'])
>>> s.add_variable('maid',['murderer','not_murderer'])
>>> s.add_variable('butler',['murderer','not_murderer'])

Adding potentials to a PotentialSystem
>>> s.add_potential([2],[0.6, 0.4]) 
>>> s.add_potential(1, [0.2, 0.8])
>>> s.add_potential([1,3,2],[ ...data... ])

As potentials are added each potential should be reshaped by the PotentialSystem instance,
however this means that the user of the class will not be interacting with the same data
structure that they input. The reshapes and transpositions could occur only when the 
joint probability is calculated. In this case, the PotentialSystem would be responsible
for the restructuring of the potentials, at least as far as keeping track of the current
number of variables (dimensions) and their string identifiers.
